# Overwatch League Stats Lab Exploration

One of my biggest passions is gaming, and Overwatch is a candidate for the game I've sunk most of my free time into. When the professional Overwatch League rolled around, I was intrigued by the city based structure that mimicked traditional sports. I latched on as a fan of the Los Angeles Valiant almost immediately and religiously watched every game in the 2018 season. Though I've since shifted my loyalties to the Chengdu Hunters, my love for the esport has not dimmed, even in the wake of the Season 3 changes.


When the Overwatch League revealed the brand new Stats Lab, I knew I had to check it out. In this GitHub repository, I'll be documenting some simple EDA and trying to answer some questions I wanted to know, as well as some more complicated stuff as my free time allows.
