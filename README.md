# Overwatch League Stats Lab Exploration

One of my biggest passions is gaming, and Overwatch is a candidate for the game I've sunk most of my free time into. When the professional Overwatch League rolled around, I was intrigued by the city based structure that mimicked traditional sports. I latched on as a fan of the Los Angeles Valiant almost immediately and religiously watched every game in the 2018 season. Though I've since shifted my loyalties to the Chengdu Hunters, my love for the esport has not dimmed, even in the wake of the Season 3 difficulties.


When the Overwatch League revealed the brand new Stats Lab, I knew I had to check it out. In this GitHub repository, I'll mostly be exploring this dataset to keep my skills sharp in between other priority projects. I'll be using a mix of everything I've learned in regards to data manipulation, visualization, and exploratory analytics.

The dataset I'm using can be found here at the [Overwatch League Stats Lab](https://overwatchleague.com/en-us/statslab)


## Season 2 Metas
In this folder, I'll be looking into the games played during the 2019 season and finding out what the most popular used heroes were. Anyone who paid attention to the season will probably be aware that the top 6 were some combination of Reinhardt, Zarya, D.Va, Lucio, Brigitte, and Zenyatta, but I'll be looking to see if there are any other patterns that slipped below the radar.
